Implementing Linear Regression from scratch and predicting marks obtained if student studied for 9.25 hrs/day

## Project 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML

Given the Iris flower dataset, our objective is to apply the K-means clustering algorithm to determine the optimal number of clusters and visually represent the clustering results.
