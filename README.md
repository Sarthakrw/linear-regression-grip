# GRIP Internship Project - The Sparks Foundation

## Project 1 : Prediction using Supervised ML

Implemented Linear Regression from scratch using first principles and mathematical formulas, developing an in-depth understanding of its mechanics, including gradient descent and cost function.

## Project 2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML

Given the Iris flower dataset, our objective is to develop K-Means Clustering model using the scikit-learn framework, clustering unlabeled data to determine the optimal number of clusters and visually represent the clustering results.
